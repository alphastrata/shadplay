## Our [bevy-shader-cheatsheet](bevy-shaders-cheatsheet.md#Contents)

Shadplay is a simple app designed to allow easy and fast prototyping and work on `wgsl` code specifically for how you'd want to do that with Bevy.
The idea is to give one the minimal amount of bevy boilerplate etc possible to get started writing glsl asap, and provide a library of examples showing how some things are done, can be done etc.

A secondary goal is to flesh out a relatively comprehensive 'port' of existing cool shader work from places like shadertoy etc -- because there's a few 'gotchas' around the differences in `glsl` and `wgsl` syntax, their respective builtins.

A tertiary goal is to surface the builtins/existing library code that Bevy's codebase provides.

### Why?

> I have found, and continue to find the shader-universe impenetrable, however: I'd rather attempt to write up and document the content I _wish_ I'd been able to find in my first google search, than complain.

## Features

- A large collection of example shaders illustrating creative and educational uses. `assets/shaders/yourshadergoeshere.wgsl` specifically focusing on `wgsl`.
- Live preview of shader code on Bevy mesh geometry.
- Automatic recompilation and update of shaders upon saving changes in your editor.
- Quick iteration and experimentation with `wgsl` shader code.
- Transparent background, with always-on-top (so you can have it on top of your editor)
- Screenshot the shader you're working on with <kbd>SPACEBAR</kbd>, this will also version the shader (at `assets/shaders/myshader.wgsl`) for you i.e:

```shell
 screenshots
└──|  01-10-23
    └──| 09-23-29
        ├──|  screenshot.png // Your screenshot
        └──|  screenshot.wgsl// The shader at `assets/shaders/myshader.wgsl`
```

- Textures, see `assets/shaders/howto-texture.wgsl`
- Mouse coords over a `uniform`, see `assets/shaders/howto-mouse.wgsl`
- Colour picker with system copy so that you get an immediate `vecf3(r, g, b)` directy available for quick pasta action.

### Keybindings:

The app has some simple hotkeys:

| Hotkey               | Action                                                                |

______________________________________________________________________

To run shadplay, you'll need the following:

- Rust (stable) - Make sure you have Rust installed on your system. You can find installation instructions at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
  _We assume you can follow their instructions to clear that hurdle_

### Installation

```shell
 $ git clone https://github.com/alphastrata/shadplay.git
 $ cd shadplay
 $ cargo run --release
```

- Then edit the `myshader.wgsl`, or `myshader_2d.wgsl`(if in 2d/shadertoy-mode) file in real time.

- Any shaders in the `assets/shaders` _not_ by the repo's owner contain links to the original work, and obviously their original glsl code is, still theirs.
- Some of those can be seen below
