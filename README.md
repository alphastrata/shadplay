## Our [bevy-shader-cheatsheet](bevy-shaders-cheatsheet.md#Contents)

Shadplay is an app designed to help you learn `wgsl` with minimal friction, specifically for those wanting to learn `wgsl` to write shaders for Bevy.
The idea is to give one the minimal amount of bevy boilerplate etc possible to get started writing glsl asap, and provide a library of examples showing how some things are done, can be done etc.

A secondary goal is to flesh out a relatively comprehensive 'port' of existing cool shader work from places like shadertoy etc -- because there's a few 'gotchas' around the differences in `glsl` and `wgsl` syntax, their respective builtins.

A tertiary goal is to surface the builtins/existing library code that Bevy's codebase provides.

### Why?

> I have found, and continue to find the shader-universe impenetrable, however: I'd rather attempt to write up and document the content I _wish_ I'd been able to find in my first google search, than complain.

## Features

- A large collection of example shaders illustrating creative and educational uses. `assets/shaders/yourshadergoeshere.wgsl` specifically focusing on `wgsl`.
- Live preview of shader code on Bevy mesh geometry.
- Textures, see `assets/shaders/howto-texture.wgsl`.
- Drag and drop `.png` or `.jpg` files onto the window to use as said textures.
- Mouse coords over a `uniform`, see `assets/shaders/howto-mouse.wgsl`.
- Colour picker with system copy so that you get an immediate `vecf3(r, g, b)` immediately available for quick pasta action.
- Drag and drop (valid `wgsl`) shaders onto the app.
- Scripts to format your `wgsl` work, so it looks more rusty.
- Scripts to pull _all_ the functions from the bevy codebase's shader code so you can easily lookup what's available for import.
- Scripts to search the bevy sourcecode (opening your browser) for specific keywords.
- Automatic recompilation and update of shaders upon saving changes in your editor.
- Quick iteration and experimentation with `wgsl` shader code.
- Transparent background, with always-on-top (so you can have it on top of your editor, most OSes should be supported).
- Screenshot the shader you're working on with <kbd>SPACEBAR</kbd>, this will also version the shader (at `assets/shaders/myshader.wgsl`) for you i.e:

```shell
 screenshots
└──|  01-10-23
    └──| 09-23-29
        ├──|  screenshot.png // Your screenshot
        └──|  screenshot.wgsl// The shader at `assets/shaders/myshader.wgsl`
```

### Keybindings:

The app has some simple hotkeys:

### To run shadplay, you'll need the following:

- Rust (stable) - Make sure you have Rust installed on your system. You can find installation instructions at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
  _We assume you can follow their instructions to clear that hurdle_

then:

### Installation

```shell
 $ git clone https://github.com/alphastrata/shadplay.git
 $ cd shadplay
 $ cargo run --release
```

- Then edit the `myshader.wgsl`, or `myshader_2d.wgsl`(if in 2d/shadertoy-mode) file in real time. (<kbd>h</kbd>, and <kbd>t</kbd> to move between 2d/3d).

- Any shaders in the `assets/shaders` _not_ by the repo's owner contain links to the original work, and obviously their original glsl code is, still theirs.
