## Resources Used in 'Might'

- **Environment Maps:**

  - `assets/environment_maps`, These are identical to those found in the Bevy repository, originally sourced from the Khronos Group. For more information, refer to `assets/environment_maps/info.txt`.

- **Knight Model (`assets/scenes/knight.glb`):**

  - The `.glb` file format is a compressed, binary version of a `.gltf` file. For more information on `.gltf` files, visit [Khronos Group GLTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf).
  - The model used is "Elysia Knight" by [Blue Spirit](https://sketchfab.com/Blue-Spirit), available for download at [Elysia Knight on Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/elysia-knight-d099f11914f445afbe727fe5c3ddd39d). Do check out their stuff! (There's a rigged version available on ArtStation too!, and it is SUPER CHEAP!).
